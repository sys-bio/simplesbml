# simplesbml

Thank you for downloading SimpleSBML!  This package supports easy SBML model construction and editing.

The documentation can be found at: http://simplesbml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

libSBML documentation: http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/index.html

SBML main page: http://sbml.org/Main_Page

## Versions: 

The current version is 2.2.0. Compared to 1.2.x series, this adds 'get' functions to interrogate an existing SBML model.

# How to install SimpleSBML

SimpleSBML can be installed via pip:

```
pip install simplesbml
```
# Python version support

SimpleSBML in theory supports Python versions 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. It definitely supports Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. SimpleSBML is a pure Python package, but relies on libSBML, which must be compiled for each supported version.
